# Here is a script that monitors and sends alerts out for some of the most critical security-related events
# that can occur on a network or system:

# Connect to Azure
Connect-AzureRmAccount

# Create a new Log Analytics workspace
$logAnalyticsWorkspace = New-AzureRmLogAnalyticsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -WorkspaceName "MyLogAnalyticsWorkspace" -Location "East US"

# Create a new Log Analytics solution
New-AzureRmLASolution -Workspace $logAnalyticsWorkspace -Name "Security" -SolutionTemplate "Security"

# Get the Log Analytics workspace ID
$workspaceId = (Get-AzureRmLogAnalyticsWorkspace -Name "MyLogAnalyticsWorkspace").WorkspaceId

# Get the Log Analytics primary key
$workspaceKey = (Get-AzureRmLogAnalyticsWorkspaceSharedKeys -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Name "MyLogAnalyticsWorkspace").PrimarySharedKey

# Create a new Log Analytics data source
New-AzureRmLogAnalyticsDataSource -Name "MyDataSource" -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -WorkspaceName "MyLogAnalyticsWorkspace" -LogAnalyticsWorkspaceId $workspaceId -SharedKey $workspaceKey -SourceType "WindowsEvent"

# Create a new Log Analytics alert rule
$webhookUrl = "https://webhookurl.com"
New-AzureRmLogAnalyticsAlertRule -Name "MyAlertRule" -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -WorkspaceName "MyLogAnalyticsWorkspace" -Condition "Event[EventID=4625 and EventData[Data[@Name='FailureReason']='An account failed to log on']" -Action "MyWebhook" -WebhookProperties $webhookUrl

# This script starts by connecting to Azure and creating a new Log Analytics workspace, which is used to collect,
# analyze, and visualize security-related data from your Azure resources. Next, it creates a new Log Analytics 
# solution, which is a pre-configured set of views and alerts that can be used to monitor for specific 
# security-related events.

# Then it retrieve the Log Analytics workspace ID and primary key, these are used to create a new data source, 
# which is used to collect data from a specific data source like windows event, in this case.

# Next, the script creates a new Log Analytics alert rule, which is used to send an alert when a specific 
# condition is met. In this example, the alert rule sends an alert when the event ID 4625 and the failure 
# reason is 'An account failed to log on' occurs. The alert is sent to a specified webhook, in this case the 
# webhookUrl value should be replaced with the actual URL you want to use.

# As before, this script is just an example and will require further customization to meet the specific
# needs of your organization.
