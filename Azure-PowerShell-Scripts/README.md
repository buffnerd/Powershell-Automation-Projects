# Azure-PowerShell-Scripts

These are just some basic Azure scripts for the purpose of automating common repetitive tasks and workflows in Azure PowerShell

In general, Azure PowerShell can be a powerful tool for automating and managing Azure resources, including security-related tasks, 
and can help cloud security engineers to be more efficient, save time and reduce the possibility of human errors.

One script automates some common repetitive tasks and workflows for a cloud security engineer

The other script monitors for some critical security-related events and sends alerts out when they occur


Keep in mind these are just examples and may need to be modified or extended to meet the specific requirements of your organization. 
Also, some of the parameters used in the script, like the location, should be changed to match your environment. It's also worth 
noting that this script is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in a production environment without thorough 
testing and validation. Additionally, it's important to follow best practices for securing your scripts, such as storing them in a 
secure location and ensuring they are kept up to date. As a cloud security engineer, you can use Azure PowerShell in combination 
with other Azure services to automate your security workflows, you can also use Azure PowerShell to automate the collection of 
security-related information from your resources and environments, generating reports and alerts, and also automating the 
remediation of security vulnerabilities.
