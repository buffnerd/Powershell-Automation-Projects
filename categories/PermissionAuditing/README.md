# Permission Auditing

Scripts to **inventory NTFS permissions** and **detect over-permissioned accounts** across Windows file servers and shares. Outputs are flattened (CSV/JSONL) for quick triage, spreadsheet review, or SIEM ingestion.

---

## Prerequisites
- Local admin or equivalent rights to read ACLs on target paths
- Sufficient permissions to enumerate subfolders and files if `-Recurse`/`-IncludeFiles`
- (Optional) **RSAT ActiveDirectory** module if using `-ExpandADGroups`
- Adequate time & disk if scanning very large trees (use depth filters)

---

## Scripts

### 1) ReportNTFSPermissions.ps1
Inventory ACLs (folders by default; files optional) and flag potential risks:
- **Broad principals** (default: Everyone / Authenticated Users / Domain Users) with **Modify/Full**
- **Explicit Deny** ACEs
- **Inheritance disabled**
- **Unresolved SIDs** (orphaned accounts)
- **Owner anomalies**

**Examples**
```powershell
# Recurse 4 levels, folders only, export CSV
.\ReportNTFSPermissions.ps1 -Path "\\fs01\Projects" -Recurse -MaxDepth 4 -OutputCsv .\ntfs_projects.csv

# Include files and resolve SIDs; JSONL output
.\ReportNTFSPermissions.ps1 -Path "D:\Data" -Recurse -IncludeFiles -ResolveSIDs -OutputJsonl .\ntfs.jsonl
```

**Adjust for your environment**
- **Paths**: `-Path` (UNC/local)
- **Depth & scope**: `-Recurse`, `-MaxDepth`, `-IncludeFiles`
- **Name resolution**: `-ResolveSIDs`
- **Risk policy**: `-BroadPrincipals`, `-HighRights`
- **Output**: `-OutputCsv`, `-OutputJsonl` (+ `-ErrorLog`)

### 2) DetectOverPermissionedAccounts.ps1
Flag Modify/Full/Write rights granted to users/groups outside an allow-list. Optional AD expansion reveals effective risk for individual users.

**Examples**
```powershell
# Flag >= Modify not in allowed list
.\DetectOverPermissionedAccounts.ps1 -Path "\\fs01\HR" -Recurse -MaxDepth 5 `
  -AllowedPrincipals 'CONTOSO\FileAdmins','CONTOSO\HR-Managers' -OutputCsv .\overperm.csv

# Expand groups to list effective users (requires RSAT AD)
.\DetectOverPermissionedAccounts.ps1 -Path "D:\Data" -Recurse -ExpandADGroups -ResolveSIDs -MinRight Write -Verbose
```

**Adjust for your environment**
- **Scope**: `-Path`, `-Recurse`, `-MaxDepth`, `-IncludeFiles`
- **Threshold**: `-MinRight` (Write/Modify/FullControl)
- **Policy**: `-AllowedPrincipals`, `-ExcludePrincipals`
- **Filters**: `-IncludePathLike`, `-ExcludePathLike`
- **Identity resolution**: `-ResolveSIDs`, `-ExpandADGroups`, `-Domain`
- **Output**: `-OutputCsv`

## Analysis Capabilities

### Permission Risk Assessment
- **Broad Access Detection**: Identifies overly permissive assignments to large groups
- **Privilege Escalation Paths**: Maps potential attack vectors through file system permissions
- **Orphaned Account Detection**: Finds permissions assigned to deleted/disabled accounts
- **Inheritance Analysis**: Reviews permission inheritance patterns and anomalies
- **Explicit Deny Monitoring**: Identifies potentially problematic deny ACEs

### Export Formats
- **CSV**: Structured tabular data for Excel analysis and reporting
- **JSONL**: JSON Lines format for SIEM ingestion and big data analytics
- **Error Logs**: Comprehensive error tracking for access denied scenarios

### Enterprise Features
- **Multi-path Analysis**: Concurrent scanning across multiple file system roots
- **Depth Control**: Configurable recursion limits for performance management
- **SID Resolution**: Optional name resolution for improved readability
- **AD Integration**: Group membership expansion for effective access analysis

## Common Use Cases

### Security Auditing
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate detailed permission reports for regulatory requirements
- **Access Reviews**: Periodic review of file system permissions across infrastructure
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify and prioritize permission-based security risks
- **Incident Response**: Analyze file system permissions during security investigations

### IT Administration
- **Permission Cleanup**: Identify and remediate excessive or inappropriate permissions
- **Migration Planning**: Document current permissions before file server migrations
- **Change Management**: Track permission changes over time
- **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose file access issues through permission analysis

### Forensic Analysis
- **Data Exfiltration Investigation**: Analyze who had access to sensitive data
- **Insider Threat Detection**: Identify unusual permission patterns or escalations
- **Evidence Collection**: Document file system permissions for legal proceedings
- **Timeline Reconstruction**: Map permission changes to security events

## Performance Considerations

### Scanning Scope
- Start with narrow scope (single share, shallow depth) to validate performance
- Use `-MaxDepth` to limit recursion depth and control scan time
- Consider `-IncludeFiles` impact on large file systems
- Monitor network traffic when scanning UNC paths

### Memory Management
- Large file systems generate substantial data - monitor memory usage
- Use CSV output for very large datasets instead of console display
- Consider breaking large scans into multiple smaller operations

### Active Directory Integration
- `-ResolveSIDs` can be slow in large domains - test performance
- `-ExpandADGroups` requires RSAT and may take time for nested groups
- Cache AD queries when possible for repeated operations

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Requirements
- Administrative privileges required for comprehensive ACL reading
- Network access needed for UNC path scanning
- Domain credentials may be required for cross-domain analysis

### Data Sensitivity
- Permission reports contain sensitive security information
- Secure storage and transmission of output files
- Consider encryption for sensitive permission data
- Implement access controls for generated reports

### Operational Security
- Audit trail for permission scanning activities
- Monitor for potential reconnaissance attempts
- Rate limiting for large-scale scans
- Coordinate with security teams for enterprise-wide scanning

---

## Tips

### Best Practices
- Start narrow (one share, shallow depth) to validate speed and permissions
- Keep an allow-list of platform/service groups that legitimately need high rights
- Use ReportNTFSPermissions to inventory and locate hotspots; then run DetectOverPermissionedAccounts on those hotspots with a tuned allow-list
- For remediation, prefer group-based ACEs over direct user ACEs; move users into least-privilege groups

### Remediation Workflow
1. **Discovery**: Use ReportNTFSPermissions to inventory current state
2. **Analysis**: Run DetectOverPermissionedAccounts with baseline allow-lists
3. **Risk Assessment**: Review findings and prioritize by business impact
4. **Remediation**: Implement least-privilege principles
5. **Validation**: Re-scan to verify changes and maintain compliance

### Integration Points
- **SIEM Integration**: Export JSONL format for automated ingestion
- **Ticketing Systems**: Generate reports for IT remediation workflows
- **Compliance Tools**: Automate permission reporting for audit requirements
- **Change Management**: Integrate scanning into file server maintenance procedures
